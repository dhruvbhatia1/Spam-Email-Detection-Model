# Spam-Email-Detection-Model

- Developed a Naive Bayes-based spam email detector using machine learning techniques.
- Utilized LabelEncoder for converting categorical email labels into numerical representations.
- Employed CountVectorizer to transform email text into numerical feature vectors.
- Trained the model on a labeled dataset consisting of spam and non-spam emails.
- Achieved accurate classification of incoming emails as spam or non-spam with 97% accuracy.
- Enhanced efficiency and accuracy by leveraging the Naive Bayes algorithm, LabelEncoder, and CountVectorizer.
- Ensured a cleaner and safer inbox experience by filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful spam emails.
